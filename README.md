# GeoCharting

A AngularJS based library to create geologic data charts.

## Introduction

This project is intended to be a library, based upon AngularJS, to allow for the graphical display 
of geologic data on the web. It generates an embedded SVG file. Currently, only a ternary plot chart 
is generated, but other charts will be added as the code base grows.
